Project 2

Due: May 13rd by 11:59 PM EDT
Background

Your team project is to make a web replica of the original game Oregon Trail. (found here: https://archive.org/details/msdos_Oregon_Trail_The_1990 ) More information on the game can also be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oregon_Trail_(video_game) 

Assignment

The project is to make this game web-based using JavaScript, PHP, AJAX, and MySQL. How you use each will be up to the team design, but at the very least, to keep the high score should be using MySQL. There will be a ton of programming just the overall game logic. This should be taken care of by JavaScript, PHP, etc…
In one departure from the original, there is an option in the game to hunt for food. This would be difficult to render in JavaScript, so to simplify have the leader of the group go fishing and give random chances on if a fish is caught, and how heavy it is.
Second departure “can” be the graphics. They do not have to be the same hideous graphics of the DOS game. You can update, but should be in the same theme.
Third, for those that were brand new to the game, some helpful hint (especially when buying or just starting to travel) would be suggested.
The database will be sparing used, but will store the high scores of all those that arrive in Oregon City. 
Finally, the game created by your team needs to reflect the same details and strategies that the original had. For instance, if someone in the simulated family gets sick, pausing for a few days from travel will heal those wounds. Research (or playing the game multiple times) is a must.
Code Requirements

If you play the game long enough, almost everything can be stored in objects. Use the DB sparingly, for example storing your high score.
Random also plays an important and significant role in this game. Make sure your team can fully identify where.
Finally, nothing should be “pre-bundled” package. This should be a custom creation. If there is a question, consult with your instructor.

Some details in scoring

Here are some screen captures of scoring in Oregon Trail. There are three options, Banker, Carpenter, and Farmer. The points are tripled for a farmer, doubled for a carpenter, etc…
